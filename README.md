# Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
I've started working through this textbook because I'm interested in learning more about systems software, and because I want to learn more about C and x86 assembly language.

So far I've found it to be a good book that covers nice stuff, and I'm now working through the text recording my notes as I go along.

## Chapter 2: Representing and Manipulating Information
This chapter is all about how the C language represents numbers and handles arithmetic.

### 2.1 Information Storage

The exercises in this section have taught me that:
1. My machine is little-endian. (Want to know what byte-ordering your system uses? Try my is-little-endian.c code, or better yet, write your own!)
2. Bit-twiddling is fun, and thinking about how to properly make a bit mask really tickles the logic nerd part of my brain.
